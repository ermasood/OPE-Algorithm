--------------------------------
For running OPE on featuresets:
-------------------------------

Run the OPE Algorithm. 
Go to the feature tab. 
load the feature set (Sample featuresets are provided in this folder
Or you can load your own features in the format Rows: # of samples; Coloumns: # of features)
load the ground truth
Press start OPE Algorithm. 

Algorithm will gives the optimised results in table and the graphs shows 
the learning process of OPE algorithm and clustering result at optimised parameter.

----------------------------------
For Runnning OPE on Spikes
-------------------------------
Run the OPE Algorithm. 
Go to the Spikes tab. 
load the Spikes set (Sample spikesets are provided in this folder
Or you can load your own spikes in the format Rows: # of samples; Coloumns: # of points in a vector)
load the ground truth
Press start OPE Algorithm. 

Algorithm will gives the optimised results in table and the graphs shows 
the learning process of OPE algorithm and clustering result at optimised parameter.

--------------------------------
For running OPE on Datsets:
-------------------------------

Download the datasets from the following link. 

http://www.vis.caltech.edu/~rodri/Wave_clus/Simulator.zip

Reference: Rodrigo Quian Quiroga (2004),Unsupervised spike detection and sorting.
 
Instructions: 

Copy and paste the link into the browser. It will automatically start downloading the datsets. 

Run the OPE Algorithm. 
go to the data tab. 
load the dataset
select the principal components. default value is 10

Select the feature extraction techniques from PCA and Wavelets,
You must select one technique before going to start algorithm. 
after selecting the feature extraction technique 
Press start OPE Algorithm. 

Algorithm will gives the optimised results in table and the graphs shows 
the learning process of OPE algorithm and clustering result at optimised parameter.
